        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Biodiversity in National Park Data Project!
          For this project, I interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.
          Perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of species;
          Investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.
          During this project, I analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.
        </p>

          TreesTreesTrees:
          This project creates a fractal tree that appears on the canvas when you run the code. 
          The setup function is called once when the sketch starts,
          and draw is called repeatedly, 
          which allows for the animation of the tree growing.
          The branch function is called recursively to create the fractal pattern. 
          The len parameter controls the length of the branch, 
          and the angle variable controls the angle of rotation for the branches.
          You can experiment with different values for these variables to change the appearance of the fractal.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
          Next.js Portfolio Project:
          I also have my portfolio available running in Next.js here. I wanted to work with React and beyond that I found Next.js 
          Although a bit simple in design. It showcase my ability to work on new technologies in a great-pace.
          Completion time: 4 days.
